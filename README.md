# Fun Pesapal Challenges
These are 3 simple applications that solve some challenging problems with each contained in its own directory. Starting off with the first:

1. ### [Dictionary Scrapping](https://github.com/JPozlo/Fun-Pesapal-Problems/tree/master/Dictionary%20Scrapping) <br/>
This app fetches data from a web page and extracts only the text from it. Afterwards, the unique words contained in the text are saved to two files, 
with one file containing the words in a sorted order and the other with their occurence count too.

2. ### [Fermat's Last Theorem](https://github.com/JPozlo/Fun-Pesapal-Problems/tree/master/Fermat's%20Last%20Theorem) also known as **Fermat near-misses** <br/>
This app verifies whether Fermat's theorem can be debunked or if it actually is accurate. The theorem states that
no three distinct positive integers a, b, and c can satisfy the equation(a^n + b^n = c^n) if n is an integer greater than two (n > 2). <br/>
**How it works:** The app takes in the 4 variables as parameters and tries to verify if indeed the theorem is correct.

3. ### [Markdown Converter](https://github.com/JPozlo/Fun-Pesapal-Problems/tree/master/Markdown%20Converter) <br/>
This app takes in markdown text as input and converts it into HTML format. After conversion, the text is saved in a HTML file.
